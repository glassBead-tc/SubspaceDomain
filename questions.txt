Before I start creating the CDP implementation, I'd like to ask you a few questions to better understand your requirements:

1. What is the primary purpose of the Client Discovery Protocol (CDP) within your MCP bridge server? Is it meant to standardize how clients discover and connect to each other?
2. What specific capabilities or features should CDP include? For example:
 Client registration/deregistration  
 Client capability discovery
4.  Connection establishment
 Health monitoring
Reconnection handling
Are there any specific requirements for the protocol format? Should it follow JSON-RPC 2.0 like the main MCP protocol?
How should CDP integrate with the existing MCP implementation? Should it be a separate module or an extension of the current protocol?
Are there any specific security considerations for client discovery that should be addressed in the protocol?
Do you have any preferences for the directory structure or naming conventions for the CDP implementation?
This information will help me create a more tailored and effective implementation of the Client Discovery Protocol.

1. Yes, and specifically how "Janus agents" can discover other agents with MCP clients through our server.

2. I want these:

Client registration/deregistration
Connection establishment
Health monitoring
Reconnection handling

3. I think it should also use JSON-RPC-2.0 as the wire format, but should also be as liberal as MCP with it if necessary.

4. This I don't know yet, we'll look

5.
