  - [x] Reconnection logic for clients
  - [x] Graceful handling of client disconnections
- [x] Connection monitoring
  - [x] Connection status tracking
  - [ ] Heartbeat mechanism
- [x] Improved logging
  - [x] Structured logging format
  - [x] Log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
  - [ ] Log rotation

### macOS Service Integration
- [x] Basic LaunchAgent configuration
- [ ] Complete service lifecycle management
  - [ ] Proper startup sequence
  - [ ] Graceful shutdown
  - [ ] Crash recovery
- [ ] Service status monitoring
  - [ ] Health check endpoint
  - [ ] Status reporting
- [ ] User-friendly CLI
  - [ ] Install/uninstall commands
  - [ ] Start/stop/restart commands
  - [ ] Status command

### State Management
- [x] Basic client state tracking
- [x] Persistent client registration
  - [x] File-based storage
  - [ ] Encryption for sensitive data
- [x] Recovery mechanisms
  - [x] Reconnection of known clients
  - [x] State restoration after restart
- [x] Client session management

- [ ] Configuration generator tool

## 3. Feature Enhancements

### Security
- [ ] Socket permissions
- [ ] Client authentication
- [ ] Request validation

### Performance
- [ ] Message batching
- [ ] Connection pooling
- [ ] Resource usage optimization

### Extensibility
- [ ] Plugin system
- [ ] Custom transport support
- [ ] API for third-party integrations

## 4. Documentation and Distribution

### User Documentation
- [ ] Installation guide
- [ ] Configuration guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

### Developer Documentation
- [ ] Architecture overview
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Contributing guide

### Distribution
- [ ] Installation script
- [ ] Homebrew formula
- [ ] Release packages

## Current Focus

We are currently focusing on completing the core implementation:

1. Enhancing the Unix Socket Transport with better error handling and logging
2. Finalizing the macOS Service Integration
3. Implementing persistent client state management

## Next Milestone

Our next milestone is to have a fully functional macOS-native bridge server with:
- Robust Unix socket transport
- Complete launchd integration
- Persistent client state
- Basic client discovery and registration
